              Looks like it's a little bit chilly, huh?
              How about you listen to some trap music to get you going?
              I promise it will warm you up.

              Well, it's not warm but it is not that cold either, is it?
              How about you listen to some country music to hype you up?
              I know how low temperatures can make you feel sad sometimes...

            <p>
              If you complain about this nice and warm weather, I will be mad.
              How about you listen to some hip hop to get that momentum going?
              Who doesn't like to burst some rhymes?

              Stop crying.. wait, is that sweat? uh.. Gross!
              How about you chill a bit while listening to some chill music?
              I will let you pick, pick wisely and just don't sweat more than you already are.
